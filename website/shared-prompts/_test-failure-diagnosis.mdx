$FAILURE_DESCRIPTION

Use the code research to analyze the test failure above.

DIAGNOSE:

1. Examine the test code and its assertions.
2. Understand and clearly explain the intention and reasoning of the test - what is it testing?
3. Compare against the implementation code being tested
4. Identify the root cause of failure

DETERMINE:
Is this a test that needs updating or a real bug in the implementation?

Provide your conclusion with evidence.
