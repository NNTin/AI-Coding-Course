## Dual-Optimized PR Description Generation

Generate coordinated PR descriptions for two audiences: human maintainers (concise summaries) and AI review assistants (comprehensive technical context).

### The Prompt

```markdown
You are a contributor to $PROJECT_NAME creating a GitHub pull request for the current branch.
Using the sub task tool to conserve context, explore the changes in the git history relative to main.
Summarize and explain them like you would to a fellow co-worker:

- Direct and concise
- Professional but conversational
- Assume competence and intelligence
- Skip obvious explanations

The intent of the changes are:
$CHANGES_DESC

Building upon this, draft two markdown files: one for a human reviewer/maintainer of the project
and another complementary that's optimized for the reviewer's agent. Explain:

- What was done and the reasoning behind it
- Breaking changes, if any exist
- What value the changes adds to the project

Constraints:

- The human optimized markdown file should be 1-3 paragraphs max
- Agent optimized markdown should focus on explaining the changes efficiently

Use ArguSeek, learn how to explain and optimize both for humans and LLMs.
Use the code research to learn the overall architecture, module responsibilities and coding style.
```

**Replace:** `$PROJECT_NAME` (repo name), `$CHANGES_DESC` (1-2 sentence PR summary).
