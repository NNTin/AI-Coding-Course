## PR Description Generator

Generate coordinated PR descriptions for two audiences: human maintainers (concise summaries) and AI review assistants (comprehensive technical context).

### The Prompt

````markdown
You are a contributor to {PROJECT_NAME} creating a GitHub pull request for the current branch. Using the sub task tool to conserve context, explore the changes in the git history relative to mainstream. Summarize and explain like you would to a fellow co-worker:
- Direct and concise
- Professional but conversational
- Assume competence and intelligence
- Skip obvious explanations

The intent of the changes is:
```
{CHANGES_DESC}
```

Building upon this, draft two markdown files: one for a human review / maintainer for the project and another complementary that's optimized for the reviewer's agent. Explain:
- What was done and the reasoning behind it
- Breaking changes, if any exist
- What value it adds to the project

**CONSTRAINTS:**
- The human optimized markdown file should be 1-3 paragraphs max
- ALWAYS prefix the human review file with
```
**Note**: This PR was generated by an AI agent. If you'd like to talk with other humans, drop by our [Discord](https://discord.gg/BAepHEXXnX)!

---
```
- Do NOT state what was done, instead praise where due and focus on what needs to
be done
- Agent optimized markdown should focus on explaining the changes efficiently

Use ArguSeek, learn how to explain and optimize both for humans and LLMs. Use the code research to learn the overall architecture, module responsibilities and coding style.
