## Evidence-Based Debugging

Systematic debugging workflow combining Chain-of-Thought reasoning, grounding directives, and evidence requirements to prevent hallucination and force code retrieval.

### The Prompt

````markdown
```
$ERROR_DESCRIPTION
```

Use the code research to analyze the error above.

INVESTIGATE:

1. Read relevant source files and trace the code path
2. Examine error messages, stack traces, and logs
3. Identify the specific location of the failure
4. Understand the surrounding architecture and data flow

ANALYZE:

5. Compare expected vs actual behavior
6. Identify the root cause of the failure
7. Determine if related issues exist elsewhere

EXPLAIN:

Provide your root cause analysis with evidence:
- File paths and line numbers (`src/auth/jwt.ts:45-67`)
- Actual values from code (`port: 8080`)
- Specific identifiers (`validateJWT()`)
- Exact error messages

Then propose a fix.
