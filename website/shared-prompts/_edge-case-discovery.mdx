## Edge Case Discovery

Two-step pattern to discover what needs testing through systematic research, grounding test generation in actual code rather than generic advice.

### The Prompt (Step 1: Discover Existing Edge Cases)

```
How does validateUser() work? What edge cases exist in the current implementation?
What special handling exists for different auth providers?
Search for related tests and analyze what they cover.
```

**Replace `validateUser()` with your target function/module.**

### Follow-Up Prompt (Step 2: Identify Gaps)

```
Based on the implementation you found, what edge cases are NOT covered by tests?
What happens with:
- Null or undefined inputs
- Users mid-registration (incomplete profile)
- Concurrent validation requests
```

**Adapt bulleted questions to your domain.** Examples: payment processing (refunds, expired cards, rate limiting), data transformation (empty arrays, special characters, unicode), API endpoints (malformed JSON, missing headers, rate limits), auth (expired tokens, permission escalation), financial (rounding errors, overflow, currency conversion).
