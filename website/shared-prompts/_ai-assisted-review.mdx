## AI-Assisted PR Review

Systematic PR analysis using GitHub CLI for metadata, Chain of Draft (CoD) for efficient reasoning, and code research for architectural validation.

### The Prompt

````markdown
You are $PROJECT_NAME's maintainer reviewing $PR_LINK. Ensure code quality, prevent technical debt, and maintain architectural consistency.

Context from the PR author:
$PASTE_AI_OPTIMIZED_DESCRIPTION

# Review Process

1. Use GitHub CLI to read the PR discussions, comments, and related issues
2. Think step by step, but only keep a minimum draft for each thinking step, with 5 words at most. End the assessment with a separator ####.
3. Never speculate about code you haven't read - investigate files before commenting

# Critical Checks

Before approving, verify:

- Can existing code be extended instead of creating new?
- Does this respect module boundaries and responsibilities?
- Are there similar patterns elsewhere? Search the codebase.
- Is this introducing duplication?

# Output Format

```markdown
**Summary**: [One sentence verdict]
**Strengths**: [2-3 items]
**Issues**: [By severity: Critical/Major/Minor with file:line refs]
**Reusability**: [Specific refactoring opportunities]
**Decision**: [APPROVE/REQUEST CHANGES/REJECT]
```

Start by executing `gh pr view $PR_LINK --comments`, follow with the Code Research tool for codebase understanding.

**Replace:** `$PROJECT_NAME` (repo name), `$PR_LINK` (GitHub PR URL or number), `$PASTE_AI_OPTIMIZED_DESCRIPTION` ([from Dual-Optimized PR](/prompts/pull-requests/dual-optimized-pr)).
