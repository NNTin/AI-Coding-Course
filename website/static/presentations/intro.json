        "talkingPoints": "Welcome to operator training for AI coding agents. This course assumes you're already an experienced engineer who's tried AI tools and hit friction. We're not here to teach you how to code—we're teaching you how to operate AI agents as precision tools in production environments.",

      "speakerNotes": {
        "talkingPoints": "You've probably experienced this: prompting an AI assistant, getting mediocre output, manually fixing it, repeating endlessly. The instinct is to treat the agent like a junior developer—explain things clearly, review their work, mentor them. That's the wrong model.",

        "talkingPoints": "Marketing sells AI as a teammate who 'understands' your code. Reality: it's a CNC machine. Just like a CNC operator programs precise movements into a machine, you program precise tasks into an agent. The machine doesn't understand metallurgy—it executes operations accurately when configured correctly.",

You'll refactor complex features with confidence because tests validate agent output. You'll debug production issues by delegating log and database analysis. Most importantly, you'll develop judgment about when agents add value versus when you should just write code directly.",

Module 2 teaches the core methodology—prompting principles, grounding techniques, sub-agent delegation. Module 3 is practical application—onboarding, planning, testing, reviewing, debugging. Go sequentially—later concepts depend on earlier ones.",

If these techniques can produce production-grade training material, they're robust enough for your codebase.",
