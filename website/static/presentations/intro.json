        "talkingPoints": "Welcome to operator training for AI coding agents. This isn't theory or templates—it's the systematic approach used in production to 10x output. The technology works, but most developers hit a frustration wall because they're using the wrong mental model. You'll learn to operate agents like CNC machines, not manage them like junior developers.",

      ],
      "speakerNotes": {
        "talkingPoints": "Most developers treat AI like a junior dev—checking every line, re-explaining concepts, managing mistakes. That's exhausting and defeats the purpose. Agents aren't teammates; they're tools that execute deterministically based on your specification. Like a CNC machine, if you program it correctly, it produces exactly what you asked for. If the output is wrong, the specification was wrong.",
        "timing": "2-3 minutes",
        "discussion": "Ask: How do you typically interact with AI assistants? Do you review every line? Do you explain yourself multiple times? Why? What changes if you think of it as a tool instead?",
        "context": "In production, companies shipping 2x faster aren't rewriting agent output—they're specifying tasks precisely upfront. The better your specification, the less rework.",

You'll learn three core phases: Plan (break work into agent tasks, research architecture), Execute (craft precise prompts, run operations in parallel), and Validate (use tests as guardrails, review critically). These aren't tips—they're systematic approaches that scale.",

We're not giving you templates because copying prompts doesn't build skill; understanding principles does. You still need to know architecture and design patterns. And if you haven't shipped production code, this course won't make sense.",

        "talkingPoints": "The entire course revolves around three phases. Plan: you break down work, research the codebase, ground the agent in context. Execute: you craft precise prompts, delegate to sub-agents, parallelize work. Validate: you use tests as guardrails, review code critically, require evidence of correctness. These phases repeat for every feature, refactor, and bug fix.",

You'll refactor fearlessly because you're using tests as guardrails. You'll debug issues faster by delegating log analysis to agents. Most importantly, you'll have the judgment to know when agents are the right tool and when you need to think through the problem yourself.",

        "talkingPoints": "You need production experience because the course assumes you understand architecture and design patterns. You need a CLI agent, not just a chat interface—that's how you scale operations. And you need to commit to the mental model shift.
